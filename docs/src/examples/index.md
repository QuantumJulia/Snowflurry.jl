# Examples

If you want to know how Snowflake is used, this is the palce to be.

## Introductory examples

The introductory examples are the best place to start if you are new to quantum computation. These examples take you step by step through Snowflake, gradually introduce concepts and assume no prior quantum computation knowledge. We recommend you work through these examples in order to get the most out of them.

### Get QPU metadata

In this example, we introduce the QPU interface and how to get the metadata of the machine.

Code: [examples/get\_qpu\_metadata.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/get_qpu_metadata.jl)

Documentation: [Get QPU metadata example](./introductory/get_qpu_metadata.md)

### Single-qubit readout fidelity

In this example, we cover the basics of initialization, readout, and readout fidelity.

Code: [examples/single\_qubit\_readout\_fidelity.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/single_qubit_readout_fidelity.jl)

Documentation: [Single-qubit readout example](./introductory/single_qubit_readout_fidelity.md)

### Excitation demonstration

In this example, we excite the qubit into state one.

Code: [examples/excitation\_demonstration.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/excitation_demonstration.jl)

Documentation: [Excitation demonstration](./introductory/excitation_demonstration.md)

### Hadamard transpilation

In this example, we introduce the hadamard gate and circuit transpilation.

Code: [examples/hadamard\_transplation.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/hadamard_transpilation.jl)

Documentation: [Hadamard transpilation example](./introductory/hadamard_transpilation.md)


### Entanglement demonstration

In this example, we demonstrate entanglement by generating a bell state.

Code: [examples/entanglement\_demonstration.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/entanglement_demonstration.jl)

Documentation: [Entanglement demonstration example](./introductory/entanglement_demonstration.md)

## Advanced examples

More advanced uses are covered here.

### Asyncronous jobs

In this example, we show how to submit multiple jobs to the quantum computer simultaneously.


Code: [examples/asynchronous\_jobsjl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/asynchronous_jobs.jl)

Documentation: [asynchronous jobs](./advanced/asynchronous_jobs.md)
