# Introductory examples

The introductory examples are the best place to start if you are new to quantum computation. These examples take you step by step through Snowflake, gradually introduce concepts and assume no prior quantum computation knowledge. We recommend you work through these examples in order to get the most out of them.

## Get qpu metadata

In this example, we introduce the QPU interface and how to get the metadata of the machine.

Code: [examples/get\_qpu\_metadata.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/get_qpu_metadata.jl)

Documentation: [Get QPU metadata example](./introductory/get_qpu_metadata.md)

## Single qubit readout fidelity

In this example, we cover the basics of initialization, readout, and readout fidelity.

Code: [examples/single\_qubit\_readout.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/single_qubit_readout.jl)

Documentation: [Single-qubit readout example](./introductory/single_qubit_readout_fidelity.md)


## Hadamard transpilation

In this example, we introduce the hadamard gate and circuit transpilation.

Code: [examples/hadamard\_transplation.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/hadamard.jl)

Documentation: [Hadamard transpilation example](./introductory/hadamard_transpilation.md)

## Excitation demonstration

In this example, we excite the qubit into state one.

Code: [examples/excitation\_demonstration.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/excitation_demonstration.jl)

Documentation: [Excitation demonstration](./introductory/excitation_demonstration.md)

## Entanglement demonstration

In this example, we demonstrate entanglement by generating a bell state.

Code: [examples/entanglement\_demonstration.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/examples/entanglement_demonstration.jl)

Documentation: [Entanglement demonstration example](./introductory/entanglement_demonstration.md)
