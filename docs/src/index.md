*A library for quantum computing using Julia*

Snowflurry is a pure Julia quantum computing stack that allows you to easily design quantum circuits, experiments and algorithms. Snowflurry can run these quantum applications on real quantum computers or classical simulators.

!!! warning
	Snowflurry has yet to reach version 1.0, but we intend to keep compatibility with what is documented here. We will only make a breaking change if something is broken. After version 1.0, the public API will be stable and only change with major releases.
