*A library for quantum computing using Julia*

Snowflurry is a software package for quantum computing that is written entirely in Julia. It allows you to easily design quantum circuits, experiments, and algorithms. These can then be executed on real quantum hardware or quantum computer simulators using Snowflurry.

!!! warning
	Snowflurry has yet to reach version 1.0, but we intend to keep compatibility with what is documented here. We will only make a breaking change if something is broken. After version 1.0, the public API will be stable and only change with major releases.
